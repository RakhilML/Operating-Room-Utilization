# Operating Room Utilization
* The Operating Room (OR) Scheduling Optimization project focuses on improving the efficiency of operating room utilization in a healthcare setting. 
* The optimization model developed aims to streamline OR schedules, reduce bottlenecks, and improve patient outcomes by ensuring timely procedures.
* Operating rooms are valuable resources in hospitals, and optimizing their use ensures that every available minute is dedicated to performing surgeries, thus improving overall hospital efficiency.


The file Optimization.ipynb uses glpk solver which can be installed from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/files/winglpk/GLPK-4.65/]

* The task centers on optimizing the scheduling of operating rooms in a healthcare facility over a three-month span.

* The objective is to maximize the number of procedures accommodated within this period. The model focuses on assigning procedures to available operating rooms while taking into account the duration of each procedure, room availability, and compatibility constraints.

* By identifying an optimal schedule, the aim is to improve resource utilization and maximize the number of procedures, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.
